> * **Power BI** is a business analytics service by Microsoft. It aims to provide interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end-users to create their own reports and dashboards. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Power_BI)

> * Using the **Power BI Desktop** Tool, I created Three Dashboards with multiple visualizations to get a full understanding of the data.
> * The data was gathered mainly from CSV files (all the data is included in DATA FILES). 
> * the data was assessed and cleansed, and I did some data modeling to create key links between the tables. Moreover, multiple columns and measures were created using DAX queries, in addition to multiple filters that I apply in the report section to simplify the visualization of the data. .
